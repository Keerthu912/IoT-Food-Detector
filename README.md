# IoT-Food-Detector
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
To grow strong and safe, all living things need food. It is important to maintain the hygiene of food for good health and to avoid wastage of food.  In recent   times we  have  many  technologies  to   detect   the   food  spoilage. But these technologies are applicable only for the normal people so our idea is for physically challenged people especially for blind people.

COMPONENTS REQUIRED
a) NodeMCU ESP8266
b) DHT11 Sensor module
c) MQ4 Sensor Module
d) Buzzer
e) Connecting Wires

EXISTING METHODOLOGY
1) The early detection of gas from food is
detected using gas sensor.
2) The consumer gets the quality information
through LED Display or via mobile phone.
3) The use of this technology helps in the
maintenance of good health by avoiding the
consumption of good food in this manually
the food items were tested and no IoT
involved before.

PROPOSED METHODOLOGY
1) The integrated IoT-based online
monitoring approach using smart logistics
can address the critical needs of reducing
food waste, increasing transportation
efficiency, and tracking food
contamination using Thingspeak
indentifying temperature, humidity,
methane gas and here we have added the
buzzer to indicate the quality of food
especially for the welfare of blind people.
2) This is especially for blind people so the
buzzer is used here and many researches
are going on for this IoT food detector
using the Artificial intelligence and
Machine learning algorithms for the
welfare of people.

CONCLUSION
This is especially for blind people so the buzzer is used here and many researches are  going on for this food spoilage detectors using the Artificial intelligence and Machine learing algorithms for the welfare of people.
